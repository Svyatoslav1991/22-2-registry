# 22-2-registry

Write a program "Registry".
At the input of the program come lines with surnames or the line Next. People who have arrived stand in a queue, and at the Next request, you need to call the person with the last name that comes first in lexicographic order (in alphabetical order) to the registry and display his last name on the screen. Surnames of patients may be repeated.
Each query (append and output) should run in O(logn).
The program uses only header files <iostream>, <string>, <map>
